    BADGE

-->


<h2 id="badge">Badge</h2>

<p>The badge is used for any image that represents a brand, identity, accolade, status or similar marking.</p>


<h3>Badge - standard</h3>

<p>Every effort should be made to provide a badge as an SVG. The build process will generate a fallback PNG. So that this PNG is of a reasonable quality, SVG's should be around 300px high and include width and height attributes <em>initially</em>.
SVGO removes these attributes for the final SVG output, but svg2png requires that they're present when it runs.</p>

<p>By default, badges are <em>intrinsically</em> sized, meaning they'll be a <em>small</em> as possible. Without a <code>height</code> attribute on the <code>img</code> tag, or a CSS (min-)height, the badges will collapse to nothing, so make sure one of those is in place.</p>

<p>^ I need to check that this is still true.</p>
<p>Badges that are part of lists or other layout should probably try to fill the container (possibly with some max-height cap). WIP: it's probably up to the layout to force it's contents to fill it's space but this is tricky. Separation of concerns etc. May opt for a c-badge-fill-container class?</p>

<p>Also note that as with other images, the NoCSS scenario is catered for by the <code>height</code> and <code>width</code> attributes so that images are kept a manageable size. Failed CSS allows TFS to take over, and it has default responsive image CSS of <code>max-width: 100%; height: auto;</code> - without the attributes you can get massive images, or without <code>height: auto;</code> you get messed up aspect ratios.</p>

<h3>Badge - page brand</h3>

<p>This type of badge is used for the brand of 'badged sections'.</p>
<p>It's designed to be in the sidebar at full width, or limited width in single-column layout.</p>

<p>This method ensures the main brand is always shown in SVG-supporting browsers, as it doesn't rely on an external resource.</p>
<p>The fallback PNG is still external, but there is only a very very small chance of a non-SVG-supporting browser also failing to load the fallback image.</p>
<p>This pattern should ideally only be used once per page due to the extra markup weight, but if necessary, it can be used more than once.</p>
